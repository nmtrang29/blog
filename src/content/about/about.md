Designing tools for engineers at [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com).</br>
Previously: [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/),  [Edenspiekermann](https://www.edenspiekermann.com/eu/), [Publicis London](https://publicislondon.co.uk/), [Momkai](https://www.momkai.com/), and [Studio Naam](https://studionaam.com/). 

In my work, I design products with an emphasis on simplicity, practicality, and craft. With a decade of experience spanning design consultancy, music tech, and developer tools, and an interest in programming and AI technologies, I’m adaptable and resourceful. I’m comfortable navigating ambiguity in complex problem spaces, driving both strategy and execution to help teams move forward and build great products.
