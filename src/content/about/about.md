I'm Trang, Senior Product Designer at [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com). My current focus is on simplifying complex workflows across the [APM](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/apm/) product. Previously, I worked at [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) and [Edenspiekermann](https://www.edenspiekermann.com/eu/).

In my work, I design products with an emphasis on simplicity, practicality, and craft. A generalist and a lifelong learner, I bring over a decade of experience across branding, advertising, music tech, and developer tools. I'm adaptable and resourceful, comfortable navigating ambiguity, learning quickly, and doing what it takes to move teams forward and deliver a good product experience end to end.
