Designing tools for engineers at [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com). Previously at [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) and [Edenspiekermann](https://www.edenspiekermann.com/eu/).

In my work, I design products with a focus on simplicity, practicality, and craft. A generalist and a lifelong learner, I bring over a decade of experience across branding, advertising, music tech, and most recently, developer tools. I'm adaptable and resourceful, comfortable navigating ambiguity, learning quickly, and doing what it takes to move teams forward and deliver a good product experience end to end.
