Designing tools for engineers at [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com). 

In my work, I approach every project with a beginner's mindset. Being highly curious about the problems and a willingness to acquire domain-specific knowledge have allowed me to connect the dots, steer product teams to better, more user-centric solutions. I thrive in teams where engineers, designers, and PMs work closely together and there is no strict divider between the disciplines.

Previously, I worked at Ableton and Edenspikermann.
