Designing tools for engineers at [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com).</br>
Previously: [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/),  [Edenspiekermann](https://www.edenspiekermann.com/eu/), [Publicis London](https://publicislondon.co.uk/), [Momkai](https://www.momkai.com/), and [Studio Naam](https://studionaam.com/). 

In my work, I design products with an emphasis on simplicity, practicality, and craftsmanship. With over a decade of experience spanning design consultancy, music tech, and developer tools, I'm adaptable and resourceful. I’m comfortable navigating ambiguity, driving both strategy and execution, and doing what it takes to move teams forward and deliver thoughtful, end-to-end product experience.
