In August 2018, I took part in an intensive 4-week full-time course on creative applications of Machine Learning at [School of Machines](https://www.schoolofma.org/) in Berlin. The course was led by [Gene Kogan](https://genekogan.com/) and [Andreas Refsgaard](https://www.andreasrefsgaard.dk/), and was designed to encourage experimentation, interaction, and to have fun with algorithms and machine learning.

During the course, we learned about:
- Various types of supervised ML (classification, regression and dynamic time wrapping) using [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/)
- Sending and receiving OSC messages via [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/) using Processing and Openframeworks to create interactive applications
- Generative models. Preparing datasets and training custom models on [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/)

Many of the experiments from that course, and the year that followed, were documented here on my previous blog and on Github.
