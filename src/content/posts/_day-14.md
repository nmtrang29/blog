title: Day 14 of learning to code

It's been 14 days since I challenged myself to learn to code everyday by following the Go/Python path on Boot.dev. It's been really fun overall and I'm consistently spending at least a hour a day on this, maybe two or longer on the weekend. I blasted through the few courses, slowed down with OOP and was kind of struggling with building the Asteroid game. I finished it in 2 days but had to look up the solutions 5 times so I was feeling a bit down.

I took a detour and made adjustments to this little pomodoro timer app that I found to display a set of emoji instead of the countdown. It's a tiny change but I wrote it myself and I'm so proud, especially after the Asteroid game. I did actually look up other beginner projects to practice OOP concepts but none of them seem fun, so I decided to make this and then continue with the next course, Functional Programming!
