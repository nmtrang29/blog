## Concept

A fun little website I built for fun little website for generating Bufo slack emojis. The goal was to create a fast, simple, and fun way for users to turn static images into loopable GIFs with built-in animation styles. Vibecoded using Cursor, the tool includes a range of fun customization options:

ðŸŽ¨ Eyes, mouth, cheeks, hats

ðŸ’ª Independent arm positions

ðŸ”€ Randomize mode

ðŸŽ‰ Celebration confetti

In a world of remote work and emoji-driven communication, non-verbal tone matters. Iâ€™ve found that custom emojis arenâ€™t just decorative â€” they help express intent, build culture, and foster camaraderie. The Bufo emoji series became a hit within my team, and this tool was my way of amplifying that energy â€” while exploring creative coding in Cursor.
## About Bufo / Froge 
"Bufo also known as Froge or Concerned Frog refers to a set of Discord emotes of a worried or concerned frog expressing various emotions, similar to Pepe emotes. The frog image comes from the now-inactive mobile game Froge, released in 2014 by Fandom Inc. and became popularized as a set of Discord emotes starting in 2020. In 2023, a Froge ChatGPT plugin launched ([source](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/froge-worry-frog))."
