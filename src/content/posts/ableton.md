From 2019 to 2022, I worked as a designer in the Sound department at Ableton, where I focused on crafting interfaces for instruments and audio effects within Ableton Live. This is the company's flagship music production software that has shaped music culture for over two decades. The Sound team that I was part of is responsible for developing the instruments and effects that power Abletonâ€™s ecosystem of creative tools.
