In 2023, I led the design of [Trace Queries](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/trace-queries/), a product that significantly improves the analytical capability of distributed traces.

##### Impact
- Successfully launch a major initiative for APM, a $500M ARR business for Datadog
- Achieving from <mark>0 to over 40,000</mark> monthly active users a few months after GA.

##### Role
-  I owned the entire design life cycle including research, strategy, design execution and user evaluation.
- The team consists of over 30 people including PM, TPM, Staff+ Engineers, and Engineering Managers. Before launch, the work went through multiple rounds of review by VPs of Engineering, Product, and Design.

##### Timeline
- 6 months from conception to private beta 
- 4 months from private beta to public release

## Problem: Itâ€™s hard to find the right trace
A real-life example: In Jan 2023, Datadog customers reported that the UI failed to load traces, which means that there are issues with this path.

With the query language at the time, you canâ€™t express structure. The UI only allows you to users to write this query, which means traces you do not need would also show up in the results.

```

> Datadog have the data but users cannot query for it. They cannot query for a specific sequence of events based on the relationship between spans.

- Which errors in trace-query service result in an upstream errors?
- Upstream service calls grouped by service
- Downstream service calls with high latency
- Traces where one service calls another more than 10 times

Workarounds (inject spans to get more info, resort to logs, keep browsing...) are manual and time-consuming.

## Solution:
A new query language that can express more complex questions

- Structural operators (child & descendant) `->` `=>` 
- Logical operators `and` `or` `not`	
- Aggregations `span_count()` 
- E2E traces `trace_duration`
